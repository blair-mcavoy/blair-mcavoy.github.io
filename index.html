        <h2>Course Overview</h2>
        <p>Introduction to Computer Science allows students to engage with computer science as a medium for creativity, communication, problem solving, and fun. Students will create computer programs including games and interactive media, develop their creative and computational thinking skills, and make personal connections to computing. Many young people with access to computers participate as consumers, rather than designers or creators. Introduction to Computer Science emphasizes the knowledge and practices young people need to create the types of dynamic and interactive computational media they enjoy in their daily lives. 
        </p>
        <p>This course will follow Code.org’s CS Discoveries curriculum with an infusion of interest-based projects, industry-level tools and other learning platforms. Throughout the year, students will practice coding skills on Code.org’s interactive, guided platform. As skills become solidified, students can choose from a number of platforms to complete their projects.</p>

        <h2> Learning Objectives</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Programming Skills: Students should demonstrate a strong understanding of the following concepts: sequence, input, output, control structures (loops and conditionals), variables, operators</li>
          <li>Computer Science Concepts: Students should demonstrate a strong understanding of the following concepts: development environments, compiling, running, development process (design, build, test, iterate).</li>
        <li> Creativity and Innovation: Students should be able to apply existing knowledge to generate new ideas, products, or processes. Students will create original work as a means of personal or group expression.</li>
        <li> Communication and Collaboration: Students should be able to present their work, communicate ideas and information, explain their process, and provide thoughtful feedback to their peers. Students will interact, collaborate, and present with peers through various group projects.</li>
        <li> Research and Information Fluency: Students will be able to gather, evaluate, and une information from a variety of sources effectively in order to complete their work. Students should be able to evaluate and select information and tools based on the specific task at hand. </li>
        <li>  Critical Thinking, Problem Solving, and Decision Making: Students should be able to identify and define authentic problems and significant questions for investigation. They will plan and manage activities to develop a solution or complete a project. They will collect and analyze data to identify solutions and make informed decisions. They will use multiple processes and diverse perspectives to explore alternative solutions.</li>
        <li>   Digital Citizenship: Students will advocate and practice safe, legal, and responsible use of information and technology. They will exhibit a positive attitude toward using technology that supports collaboration, learning, and productivity. </li>
        </ul> 
        
        <h2> Grading</h2>
        <p>This course is entirely project based. Students will demonstrate the skills they have learned in each unit through an interest-based project. Rubrics will be provided for each project to help students make sure they address all of the important concepts from the unit in their project. Students will also present each project, sometimes informally and sometimes formally. In-class participation is another large component of this class. Students will earn participation points by completing Code.org modules and contributing to in-class discussions.</p>
